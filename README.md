Heyy, Welcome to my Go Crash course repository! If you're just starting out with Go or looking to level up your skills and become an advanced gopher, I intend to make this repository an ultimate resource packed with beginner-friendly exercises, cheat sheets, project building guides, and more, tried best to design this as a guide for you on your journey from novice to advanced Gopher!

## What's Inside

### Beginner-Friendly Exercises
- Learn by building! that's how I did it, hence this repo includes a lot of hands-on exercises tailored for beginners, helping you learn the fundamentals of Go programming
- Practice with simple yet effective tasks that gradually introduce you to the language's syntax, concepts, and best practices. This is not an exhaustive guide! this should be an indicator, googling to learn more about the concepts is my forever suggestion.

### Cheat Sheets
- I have included my concise cheat sheets that serve as quick references for important Go concepts, syntax, and idioms.
- You can use them as handy reminders while coding or as study aids to reinforce your understanding of key topics

### Project Building Guides
- Build essential projects that every gopher should have in their arsenal, including RESTful APIs, client applications, and command-line interface (CLI) tools.
- Follow step-by-step guides accompanied by explanations, tips, and tricks to master various aspects of Go development.

### Building Famous Projects

Go is learnt by building! Explore and build famous projects that every advanced gopher begins their journey with. 
For example:
1. REST APIs
2. Client applications like ClientGO
3. CLI tools

### Testing
- We will also explore testing in Go and learn how to write robust test suites for your applications.

### Exploring Packages and Libraries
- We will see the vast ecosystem of Go packages and libraries that makes Go our favourite language!
