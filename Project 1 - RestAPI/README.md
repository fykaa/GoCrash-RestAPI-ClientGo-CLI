## Go REST API Tutorials

This repository provides a collection of tutorials demonstrating how to build RESTful APIs with the Go programming language. It explores various popular libraries like `mux` and `gin` to equip you with different approaches to API development in Go.

### What you'll find

* **Step-by-step guides:** Each section should guide you through the process of building a specific API, explaining concepts and code along the way
* **Multiple libraries:** You can explore different approaches to API development using various Go libraries!
* **Clear structure:** I tried to write these in a easy and well-organized and easy to follow, making learning easy

### Getting started

1. **Clone the repository:** Use `git clone git@github.com:fykaa/Go-Rest-API-tutorial.git` to download the code
2. **Choose a tutorial:** Select the tutorial that interests you based on the API functionality or library used
3. **Follow the instructions:** Each tutorial in this repo provides clear steps to set up, code, and run the API

### Learning objectives

* Understand the principles of RESTful APIs.
* Build basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Go APIs.
* Utilize different libraries like `mux` and `gin` for API development.
* Gain practical experience in building Go web services.
* Eventually realize how same features can be implemented using so many libraries in Go, realizing how unique of a language is it!
