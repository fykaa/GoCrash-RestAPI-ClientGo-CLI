## Fun Facts in Go


Did you know? In Go, the interface{} type serves as a wildcard, allowing functions to return values of any type. For example, imagine a function called functionOfSomeType() that returns interface{}. This means it can return a value of any type! This flexibility enables Go programs to handle a wide range of data types seamlessly, making coding in Go both dynamic and exciting!
e.g.
```go
func functionOfAnyType() interface{} {
	return 42
}
```
can also be
```go
func functionOfAnyType() interface{} {
	return true
}
```
